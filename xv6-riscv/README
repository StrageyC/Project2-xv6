# Lottery Scheduler

## kernel/proc.c

### get getpinfo() andsettickets()

> Created two functions: getpinfo which returns the pstat struct and settickets which setts a processes tickets

### scheduler()

> changed scheduler from roundrobin to lottery. Scheduler gets random number from 0 to the total number of tickets
> allocated and choose one randomly using random.c. Scheduler loops through processes and counts each process tickets
> until the randomly chosen number is less than the ticket of a process plus any previous tickets. 

## lotterytest.c, p2.c, p3.c

### To test in a 1:2:3 ratio:  

> run lotterytest and p2 in backround and finally run p3. This will run indefinately!
